<p>My name is Xiulin Yang and I'm currently a second-year master's student learning Computational Linguistics at Saarland Unviersity. I'm also working in Professor Alexander's cookbook group doing coreference resoultion in recipes. </p>

<p>My interest mainly lies in Computational Linguistics, Sytnax and its interface with Semantics. I wonder how much machine can grasp meaning and how we can improve it. I believe linguistics can provide inspirations to build more explainable and robust large neural language models in the way that it helps people to know the limitation and strengths of them. </p>
